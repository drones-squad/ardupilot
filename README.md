# ardupilot
ardupilot running on top of nuttx v7.xx WIP

Ardupilot uses nuttx v6.xxx wich is outdated and has none/limited support for new/future hardware.
By porting to nuttx V7.xx will permit usage of more advanced and powerfull hardware.

Since ardupilot is open source everybody is welcome to contribute.
